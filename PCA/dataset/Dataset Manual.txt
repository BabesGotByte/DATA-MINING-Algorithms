Create two folders named as "photos" and "compressed" in "dataset" folder.
Save photos(10 preferred) of each of your friend in the folder named as "photos".
The photos should be named as "Saumya_1.jpeg" , "Saumya_2.jpeg"....."Saumya_10.jpeg" and so on.
The photos must be clicked at different angles(i.e. right profile, left profile, front facing and so on).
Keep the "compressed" folder empty.
When you will run the code, the photos from the "photos" folder will get saved to "compressed" folder after their size is compressed.
